      <div class="prelude"><h2>SACRIFICE</h2><p>It was never taken from you. You offered it without knowing.</p></div>
      <div class="prelude"><h2>DOMINION</h2><p>He who rules never needs to speak. His shadow commands enough.</p></div>
      <div class="prelude"><h2>DEBT</h2><p>The coin was buried long ago. But the curse still breathes.</p></div>
      <div class="prelude"><h2>TORCH</h2><p>What you learn will burn you. What you forget will feed it.</p></div>
      <div class="prelude"><h2>SUNDIAL</h2><p>Time does not pass. It watches, waiting for the hour you break.</p></div>
      <div class="prelude"><h2>SILENCE</h2><p>No voice. No scream. Just the echo of what you deserved.</p></div>
      <div class="prelude"><h2>WHISPER</h2><p>The lie was never spoken. You simply believed it.</p></div>
      <div class="prelude"><h2>AWAKEN</h2><p>You were never asleep. You just didn’t want to remember.</p></div>
      <div class="prelude"><h2>FRACTURE</h2><p>The truth didn’t shatter. You did.</p></div>
